The sun rose early in the morning, casting its light across the vast sky. The sky was clear, with only a few clouds scattered around, letting the sun shine brightly. As the day progressed, the clouds gathered more densely, occasionally hiding the sun from view. People looked up at the sky, watching the movement of the clouds and wondering when the sun would emerge again.

The warmth of the sun brought comfort, even as the sky darkened slightly with more clouds rolling in. Birds flew across the sky, dipping and gliding around the clouds, enjoying the light and warmth of the sun. By evening, the sun began to set, painting the sky with hues of orange and pink, while the clouds turned golden, drifting softly across the sky.
